I am now a first-year Ph.D. student at the [College of AI](https://collegeai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University, advised by Professor [Jingzhao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8NudxYsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am also an intern of [Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute](https://www.sqz.ac.cn/). Previously, I did my undergraduate at School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology.

I am a deeply interest-driven individual, and I pursue research purely out of passion. I firmly believe that exceptional ideas and groundbreaking advancements in academia often emerge from open exchanges and the collision of diverse perspectives. If you have any insights, differing opinions on my work, or fresh ideas you wish to share, I would be truly grateful to hear from you.

I welcome any opportunity to connect and exchange ideas with you!


<h2 class="section-title">Research Interest</h2>
My research focuses on machine learning, both on the theoretical and empirical sides. On the theoretical side, I enjoy conducting various experiments and constructing appropriate and realistic theoretical frameworks based on the results. On the empirical side, I have hands-on experience with supervised fine-tuning of large-scale LLMs and reinforcement learning. Recently, I have been particularly interested in the optimization aspect of LLM pre-training and the RL aspect of post-training.

I have worked on topics including:
- Scalable Model Merging. 
- Optimization Algorithm for LLM.
- Training Dynamics of Neural Networks.
- Reasoning Large Language Model.
- Multi turn Agent.


<h2 class="section-title">Experiences</h2>
**Ant Group** (Apr. 2025 â€“ Oct. 2025)  
*Research Intern at RL Lab*  

- Improved Reasoning LLM with RL, boosting a 1.5B model's AIME24 and AIME25 scores to 72.5 and 62.3, up over 10 points.
